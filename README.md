# movie recommendation system
I am excited to share my project where I developed a content-based recommendation system for movies using cutting-edge machine learning techniques. Recommender systems play a vital role in personalizing user experiences, and in this project, I focused on providing users with accurate and relevant movie recommendations based on their preferences.

To accomplish this, I curated a comprehensive movie dataset from Kaggle, which served as the foundation for my recommendation engine. However, before proceeding with the modeling phase, I invested significant effort in data pre-processing and cleaning. This involved handling missing values and addressing categorical data using count vectorization, ensuring the dataset was ready for the recommendation algorithm.

Next, I employed cosine similarity, a powerful technique, to calculate the similarity between movies based on their content. By extracting relevant features and applying cosine similarity, I could measure the degree of similarity between movies and identify those with comparable content.

To ensure the model's availability and seamless integration, I saved the trained recommendation model using the pickle file format. This allowed for quick and efficient retrieval and deployment of the model within the web application.

Using the Streamlit framework, I created a user-friendly web application that leverages the trained model to deliver highly accurate movie recommendations. Users can explore the application, input their movie preferences, and instantly receive a curated list of similar movies that align with their tastes.
 I was able to develop a powerful recommendation engine that enhances user experiences and aids in discovering new and exciting movies.
